# Countdown

I doesn't need a lot of explanation, it's just a ountdown.

## Technologies
I used React and Bootstrap to build the app and deployed it with netlify.

## How to use it
Just increase or decrease the amount of time you want the countdown to be long and click on the play button. The reset button will resest the time to the value you gave before, pause will pause the countdown and clear will clear it (WOW).  
Everything else is sad in the home page of the website.
